# HTML-First-time

This is a our first project as a team which focuses on the depresses people.
Since the depression becomes a common factor nowadays, we have fixed this problem and gave a feasible solution. We have designed a website which includes all the basic stuff of html, css and javascript.
For AI model, we used Sentimental Analysis algorithm as of now.
The idea or agenda is that the user will talk to the chatbot first, then after some cool conversation, by relaxing to some extent, the person will be redirected to a page where they should take a depression test.
Based on that score of evaluation, we are going to suggest food, exercise, some deliverable thoughts, positive vibes, music to reduce the level of depression.

In future, we are planning to modify the chatbot from text recognisation to audio recogisation. Also want to add some features like including chit chats with the people which may reduce some of the depression levels.
